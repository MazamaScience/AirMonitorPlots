# PWFSLSmokePlots: a marraige of ggplot2 and PWFSLSmoke

I propose a unified vision of the PWFSLSmokePlots package, which will integrate 
seamlessly into the ggplot2 and PWFSLSmoke packages. 

Everything will be based on tidy data. Luckily, we already have functions to 
go back and forth between `ws_monitor` objects and `ws_monitorTidy` objects.
